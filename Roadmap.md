## Current Status
OpenAtlas  currnet  is stable,usable  


## aapt support shared  resource
when  Android M release ,i support this feature,aapt hack  need refactor,this is  about build system

# won't fix feature
many  gay ask me,why  register activity at  manifest,i told you, OpenAtlas is  non-proxy，no  proxy implement,if you must
use, maybe  you can hack   Android  system，but  i no  idea
